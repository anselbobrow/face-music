# face-music

A face-tracking weird sound-generating project inspired by and built for Colt Steele's [Coding Challenge #2](https://youtu.be/FeT7na8yZpk). To use, go to [anselbobrow.me/facemusic](https://anselbobrow.me/facemusic), or run `npm install` and then `npm start` from a command line in the root directory.
